# Javascript monorepo starter [WiP]

Built upon vercel examples and extended to come with ready to use tools and configurations:

- @acme/style-guide - A shared package with lint staged, prettier, and eslint configs
- @acme/vite - A shared package with common vite configs for building apps and packages

For now, feel free to explore it and use the existing package README's for more information.
